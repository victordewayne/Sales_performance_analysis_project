Steps Followed:

1. Data Cleaning & Transformation in Excel:  
   - Used Excel to clean and transform raw data (e.g., handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data).
   - Created pivot tables for initial analysis and insights.
  
2. Data Storage in MySQL:  
   - Imported and stored the data in MySQL tables for better data management and relational database design.
   - Performed queries for cleaning tasks such as checking for missing values, duplicates, and consistency.

3. Data Normalization:  
   - Applied normalization techniques to ensure consistency across data fields.
     - Standardized text using transformations like Title case, Lowercase, Uppercase, and Trim.

4. Data Export for Further Analysis:  
   - Exported cleaned and normalized data as a CSV for further analysis and reporting.

5. Data Analysis with Python:  
   - Utilized Python (with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib) for:
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and trends.
     - Feature Engineering to derive meaningful insights and add valuable features for analysis.

6. Power BI for Visualization:  
   - Imported cleaned data from Python into Power BI for visual analytics.
   - Designed a comprehensive Power BI report to provide insights into:
     - Total sales by customer
     - Monthly revenue trends
     - Product sales breakdown
   - Utilized various visuals like bar charts, line graphs, and KPIs to highlight key performance metrics.
